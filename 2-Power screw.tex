\textbf{Q2}

The clamp assembly as shown in Figure Q2 consists of member AB and AC, which are pin connected at A. The clamp works by rotating a single start ACME thread $(\alpha=14.5^{\circ})$ with the size of 12.5 mm and pitch of 2.5 mm. At this instant, the compressive force, Fc on the wood between B and C is 180 N. The collar at the assembly has a mean diameter of 13.5 mm. Assume all the friction coefficient between all surface contracts is 0.3. Determine:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the load acting at the screw.

    \item the torque required to tighten the screw.

    \item the maximum compressive force, Fc, if allowable normal stress at the screw is 10 MPa.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Solution}
